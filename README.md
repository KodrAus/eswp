ESWP
====

A developer-focused Wordpress plugin for integrating Elasticsearch. ESWP gives you access to Elasticsearch via the [Elastica](https://github.com/ruflin/Elastica) PHP client so you have complete control over how your Wordpress objects are indexed, queried and displayed.

See the [docs](https://github.com/KodrAus/eswp/wiki/) for more details.

##Getting started

Upload the [eswp directory](https://github.com/KodrAus/eswp/tree/master/src/eswp) to your Wordpress plugins folder.

Point ESWP to your Elasticsearch server

Add the ESWP Search Widget to your theme. Add the Search Results and API pages to start pointing your searches at Elasticsearch.

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/KodrAus/eswp/wiki/getting-started) for a thorough guide.
